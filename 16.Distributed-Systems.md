# Chapter 16: Distributed Systems

## Advantages of Distributed Systems

A distributed system is a collection of loosely coupled processors interconnected by a communication network. From the point of view of a specific processor in a distributed system, the rest of the processors and their respective resources are remote, whereas its own resources are local.

The advantages of distributed systems include:
-   **Resource Sharing:** A distributed system allows the sharing of files and printers.
-   **Computation Speedup:** A computation can be partitioned into subcomputations that can run concurrently on different processors.
-   **Reliability:** If one processor fails, the remaining processors can continue to operate.
-   **Communication:** A distributed system allows users to communicate with each other.

## Types of Network-based Operating Systems

-   **Network Operating Systems:** Users are aware of the multiplicity of machines. They access remote resources by logging into the appropriate remote machine.
--   **Distributed Operating Systems:** Users are not aware of the multiplicity of machines. The system manages the resources of the entire system as a whole.

## Network Structure

-   **Local-Area Network (LAN):** A LAN is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.
-   **Wide-Area Network (WAN):** A WAN is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area for the primary purpose of computer networking.

## Communication Structure

The communication network is the backbone of a distributed system. The design of a communication network must address four basic issues:
1.  **Naming and name resolution:** How do two processes locate each other to communicate?
2.  **Routing strategies:** How are messages sent through the network?
3.  **Connection strategies:** How do two processes send a sequence of messages?
4.  **Contention:** The network is a shared resource, so how do we resolve conflicting demands for its use?

## Communication Protocols

A protocol is a set of rules that governs data communication. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has developed a seven-layer model for network protocols, called the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.

The seven layers of the OSI model are:
1.  **Physical layer:** Responsible for the transmission of raw bits.
2.  **Data-link layer:** Responsible for the reliable transmission of data frames.
3.  **Network layer:** Responsible for the routing of packets.
4.  **Transport layer:** Responsible for the end-to-end delivery of messages.
5.  **Session layer:** Responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating sessions.
6.  **Presentation layer:** Responsible for the translation, encryption, and compression of data.
7.  **Application layer:** Responsible for providing services to the user.

## Robustness

A distributed system is robust if it can continue to operate even if some of its components fail.

-   **Failure Detection:** The system must be able to detect failures.
-   **Reconfiguration:** The system must be able to reconfigure itself to continue operating.
-   **Recovery from Failure:** The system must be able to recover from failures.

## Design Issues

-   **Transparency:** The distributed system should appear to the user as a single computer system.
-   **Concurrency:** The system must be able to handle concurrent requests.
-   **Scalability:** The system should be able to grow as the number of users and resources increases.
-   **Security:** The system must be secure.

## An Example: Samba

Samba is an open-source implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol, which is used for file and printer sharing in Windows networks. Samba allows Linux and UNIX systems to act as file and print servers in a Windows network.
