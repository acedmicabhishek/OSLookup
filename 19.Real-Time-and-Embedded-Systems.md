# Chapter 19: Real-Time and Embedded Systems

## Real-Time Systems

A real-time system is a system in which the correctness of the system depends not only on the logical result of a computation, but also on the time at which the results are produced.

There are two types of real-time systems:
1.  **Hard real-time systems:** These systems are required to complete a critical task within a guaranteed amount of time. If the deadline is missed, the system is considered to have failed.
2.  **Soft real-time systems:** These systems have less stringent timing requirements. A critical real-time task gets priority over other tasks and retains that priority until it completes.

## Embedded Systems

An embedded system is a computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts.

Embedded systems are found in a wide variety of devices, from consumer electronics to industrial control systems.

## Real-Time Scheduling

Real-time scheduling is the process of assigning priorities to tasks in a real-time system. The goal of real-time scheduling is to ensure that all tasks meet their deadlines.

-   **Priority-Based Scheduling:** The most common approach to real-time scheduling is to use a priority-based scheduling algorithm. Each task is assigned a priority, and the scheduler always runs the task with the highest priority.
-   **Rate-Monotonic Scheduling:** A priority is assigned based on the inverse of its period. Shorter periods get higher priority; longer periods get lower priority.
-   **Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) Scheduling:** The task with the earliest deadline is given the highest priority.
-   **Proportional Share Scheduling:** This algorithm allocates T shares among all applications. An application can receive N shares of time, ensuring that the application is allocated N/T of the total processor time.

## VxWorks

VxWorks is a real-time operating system (RTOS) that is used in a wide variety of embedded systems. VxWorks is a proprietary operating system, but it is based on the open-source FreeBSD kernel.

VxWorks provides a number of features that are useful for real-time and embedded systems, such as:
-   A preemptive, priority-based scheduler.
-   A fast and deterministic interrupt response.
-   A small memory footprint.
-   A rich set of networking protocols.
