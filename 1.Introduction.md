# Chapter 1: Introduction

## What is an Operating System?

An Operating System (OS) is a software that acts as an intermediary between a computer user and the computer hardware. The primary purpose of an OS is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner.

An operating system is a crucial component of the system software in a computer system. It manages the computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

The operating system has two main goals:
1.  **To make the computer system convenient to use.** It hides the complex details of the hardware from the user.
2.  **To manage the resources of the computer system efficiently.** These resources include the CPU, memory, storage devices, and I/O devices.

## History of Operating Systems

The history of operating systems is closely tied to the evolution of computer hardware.

-   **First Generation (1940s-1950s):** The earliest computers had no operating systems. Programmers interacted directly with the hardware. Programs were written in machine language.
-   **Second Generation (1950s-1960s):** Batch processing systems were introduced. The OS was a simple program that transferred control from one job to the next.
-   **Third Generation (1960s-1970s):** Multiprogramming and time-sharing systems were developed. These systems allowed multiple users to share the computer simultaneously. Examples include MULTICS and early versions of UNIX.
-   **Fourth Generation (1970s-Present):** The era of personal computers (PCs) began. Operating systems like MS-DOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux were developed, focusing on user-friendliness and graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
-   **Fifth Generation (Present and Beyond):** This era is characterized by distributed and parallel computing, mobile operating systems (like Android and iOS), and cloud computing.

## Computer System Organization

A modern computer system consists of one or more CPUs, device controllers, and shared memory, all connected through a common bus.

-   **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions.
-   **Memory:** Stores data and instructions. Main memory (RAM) is volatile, while secondary storage (like hard drives) is non-volatile.
-   **I/O Devices:** Include keyboards, mice, monitors, printers, and network interfaces. Each device is managed by a device controller.
-   **Bus:** A communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer.

## Operating System Structure

The structure of an operating system can be designed in several ways:

-   **Simple Structure (Monolithic):** The OS is a single, large program with no well-defined structure. MS-DOS is an example.
-   **Layered Approach:** The OS is divided into a number of layers, each built on top of lower layers. This approach simplifies debugging and system verification.
-   **Microkernel:** The kernel is kept as small as possible, with most services running as user-level processes. This improves security and reliability.
-   **Modules:** The kernel has a set of core components and can link in additional services via modules at boot time or during run time. Most modern operating systems use this approach.

## Operating System Operations

Operating systems are event-driven. They wait for an event to occur, which can be either a trap (or exception) or an interrupt.

-   **Interrupts:** A signal from a hardware device to the CPU. Interrupts are used to handle events like I/O completion.
-   **Traps (Exceptions):** A software-generated interrupt caused either by an error or a user request for an OS service (a system call).
-   **Dual-Mode Operation:** The OS has two modes of operation: user mode and kernel mode (also called supervisor mode). This distinction provides protection for the OS from errant user programs.

## Process Management

A process is a program in execution. The OS is responsible for the following activities in connection with process management:

-   Creating and deleting both user and system processes.
-   Suspending and resuming processes.
-   Providing mechanisms for process synchronization.
-   Providing mechanisms for process communication.
-   Providing mechanisms for deadlock handling.

## Memory Management

Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution.

-   Keeping track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom.
-   Deciding which processes (or parts of processes) and data to move into and out of memory.
-   Allocating and deallocating memory space as needed.

## Storage Management

The OS provides a uniform, logical view of information storage. It abstracts from the physical properties of its storage devices to define a logical storage unit, the file.

-   **File Management:** The OS is responsible for creating and deleting files and directories, providing primitives to manipulate files and directories, mapping files onto secondary storage, and backing up files on stable (non-volatile) storage media.
-   **Mass-Storage Management:** The OS manages free space, storage allocation, and disk scheduling.

## Protection and Security

-   **Protection:** Any mechanism for controlling the access of processes or users to the resources defined by a computer system.
-   **Security:** Defends a system from external and internal attacks. Security measures are needed to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the system's data and resources.

## Kernel Data Structures

The kernel needs to keep track of the state of the system. It uses various data structures to do so, such as:

-   **Process Control Blocks (PCBs):** Store information about each process.
-   **File Control Blocks (FCBs):** Store information about each file.
-   **Linked Lists, Trees, and Hash Tables:** Used to organize and manage system resources.

## Computing Environments

-   **Traditional Computing:** Stand-alone general-purpose machines.
-   **Mobile Computing:** Smartphones and tablets.
-   **Distributed Systems:** A collection of physically separate, possibly heterogeneous, computer systems that are networked to provide users with access to the various resources that the system maintains.
-   **Client-Server Computing:** A distributed system structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.
-   **Peer-to-Peer Computing:** A distributed system architecture in which participants make a portion of their resources directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination instances.
-   **Cloud Computing:** A type of computing that delivers computing, storage, and even applications as a service across a network.
-   **Real-Time Embedded Systems:** Systems that have rigid time requirements on the operation of a processor or the flow of data.

## Open-Source Operating Systems

Open-source operating systems are those whose source code is freely available for anyone to inspect, modify, and enhance. Examples include Linux, Android, and FreeBSD. They foster a community of developers who contribute to their development and improvement.
