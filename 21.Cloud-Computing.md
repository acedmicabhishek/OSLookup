# Chapter 21: Cloud Computing

## Overview

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Cloud computing is a major trend in the IT industry, and it is changing the way that we design, build, and deploy applications.

## Service Models

There are three main service models in cloud computing:
1.  **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** The provider offers virtualized computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. The user is responsible for managing the operating system, applications, and data.
2.  **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** The provider offers a platform for developing, deploying, and managing applications. The user is responsible for managing the applications and data, but not the underlying infrastructure.
3.  **Software as a Service (SaaS):** The provider offers a complete application, which is accessed by the user over the Internet. The user is not responsible for managing the application or the underlying infrastructure.

## Deployment Models

There are four main deployment models in cloud computing:
1.  **Public Cloud:** The cloud infrastructure is owned and operated by a third-party provider, and it is available to the general public.
2.  **Private Cloud:** The cloud infrastructure is owned and operated by a single organization, and it is used exclusively by that organization.
3.  **Hybrid Cloud:** The cloud infrastructure is a combination of public and private clouds.
4.  **Community Cloud:** The cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations with a common interest.

## Cloud Storage

Cloud storage is a model of computer data storage in which the digital data is stored in logical pools, said to be on "the cloud". The physical storage spans multiple servers (sometimes in multiple locations), and the physical environment is typically owned and managed by a hosting company.

-   **Object Storage:** A data storage architecture that manages data as objects, as opposed to other storage architectures like file systems which manage data as a file hierarchy and block storage which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks.
-   **File Storage:** A hierarchical storage methodology used to organize and store data on a computer.
-   **Block Storage:** A technology that is used to store data files on Storage Area Networks (SANs) or cloud-based storage environments.

## Case Study: Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a popular cloud computing platform that offers a wide variety of services, including:
-   **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):** A web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
-   **Simple Storage Service (S3):** A web service that provides object storage.
-   **Relational Database Service (RDS):** A web service that provides a managed relational database.
-   **Lambda:** A serverless computing platform that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
