# Chapter 15: System Security

## The Security Problem

Security is a measure of confidence that the integrity of a system and its data will be preserved. Security must address the problem of preventing unauthorized access to a system, and the malicious or accidental destruction or alteration of data.

Security systems are based on the assumption that the world is divided into two camps: the "good guys" and the "bad guys". The good guys are the legitimate users of the system, and the bad guys are the intruders.

The four main security goals are:
1.  **Confidentiality:** Information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals.
2.  **Integrity:** Information is not modified by unauthorized individuals.
3.  **Availability:** The system is available for use by authorized individuals.
4.  **Authenticity:** The system can verify the identity of its users.

## Program Threats

-   **Trojan Horse:** A program that appears to be a legitimate application but performs malicious activities in the background.
-   **Trap Door:** A secret entry point into a program that allows someone who is aware of the trap door to gain access without going through the usual security access procedures.
-   **Logic Bomb:** A piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met.
-   **Virus:** A piece of code that is capable of copying itself and typically has a detrimental effect, such as corrupting the system or destroying data.
-   **Worm:** A standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers.

## System and Network Threats

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.
-   **Port Scanning:** An application designed to probe a server or host for open ports.
-   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** An attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.

## Cryptography as a Security Tool

Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries.

-   **Symmetric Encryption:** The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
-   **Asymmetric Encryption:** Uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
-   **Hash Functions:** A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values.
-   **Digital Signatures:** A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents.

## User Authentication

User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.

-   **Passwords:** The most common authentication method.
-   **Biometrics:** The use of physical characteristics, such as fingerprints or retinal patterns, to identify a user.
-   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** A security process in which users provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves.

## Implementing Security Defenses

-   **Security Policy:** A document that outlines the rules, laws, and practices that regulate how an organization manages, protects, and distributes sensitive information.
-   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** A device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.
-   **Auditing and Logging:** The system should keep a log of all security-related events.

## Firewalling to Protect Systems and Networks

A **firewall** is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

-   **Packet Filtering:** A firewall technique used to control network access by monitoring outgoing and incoming packets and allowing them to pass or halt based on the source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
-   **Proxy Server:** A server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.

## Computer-Security Classifications

The U.S. Department of Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), or "Orange Book," provides a set of criteria for evaluating the security of computer systems.

-   **C2:** Controlled Access Protection.
-   **B1:** Labeled Security Protection.
-   **B2:** Structured Protection.
-   **A1:** Verified Design.

## An Example: Windows 7

Windows 7 provides a number of security features, including:
-   User Account Control (UAC)
-   BitLocker Drive Encryption
-   Windows Defender
-   Windows Firewall
