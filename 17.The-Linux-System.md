# Chapter 17: The Linux System

## Linux History

Linux is a UNIX-like operating system kernel that was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It is an open-source project, and it has been developed by a community of developers from all over the world.

Linux is a popular choice for servers, embedded systems, and desktop computers. It is also the basis for the Android operating system.

## Design Principles

The Linux kernel is a monolithic kernel, but it is also modular, so new functionality can be added dynamically.

The design principles of Linux include:
-   **Multiuser:** Linux is a multiuser system, which means that multiple users can be logged in and running programs at the same time.
-   **Multitasking:** Linux is a multitasking system, which means that it can run multiple programs at the same time.
-   **Portability:** Linux is a portable operating system, which means that it can be run on a wide variety of hardware platforms.
-   **Security:** Linux is a secure operating system, with a number of security features, such as file permissions and user accounts.
-   **Open Source:** The source code for the Linux kernel is freely available.

## Kernel Modules

The Linux kernel has a modular design. A kernel module is a piece of code that can be loaded into the kernel on demand. This allows the kernel to be extended with new functionality without having to be recompiled.

## Process Management

A process in Linux is a program in execution. Each process has its own address space, and it is scheduled by the kernel.

-   **`fork()` and `exec()`:** The `fork()` system call is used to create a new process. The `exec()` system call is used to load a new program into a process.
-   **Threads:** Linux supports threads, which are lightweight processes that share the same address space.

## Scheduling

The Linux scheduler is responsible for deciding which process to run next. The scheduler is a preemptive, priority-based algorithm.

-   **Real-Time Scheduling:** Linux supports real-time scheduling, which is used for applications that have strict timing requirements.
-   **Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS):** The CFS is the default scheduler in Linux. It is a fair scheduler, which means that it tries to give each process a fair share of the CPU.

## Memory Management

The Linux memory manager is responsible for managing the physical and virtual memory of the system.

-   **Paging:** Linux uses paging to manage virtual memory.
-   **Slab Allocator:** The slab allocator is used to manage kernel memory.

## File Systems

Linux supports a wide variety of file systems, including:
-   **ext4:** The default file system in most Linux distributions.
-   **Btrfs:** A modern file system with a number of advanced features, such as snapshots and data checksums.
-   **XFS:** A high-performance file system that is often used on servers.
-   **NFS:** The Network File System is used to access files over a network.

## Input and Output

The Linux I/O system is responsible for managing the I/O devices of the system.

-   **Device Drivers:** Each device has a device driver that is responsible for controlling the device.
-   **Block I/O:** The block I/O system is used to access block devices, such as disks.
-   **Character I/O:** The character I/O system is used to access character devices, such as keyboards and mice.

## Interprocess Communication

Linux provides a number of mechanisms for interprocess communication, including:
-   **Pipes:** A pipe is a unidirectional communication channel.
-   **Shared Memory:** Shared memory allows two or more processes to share a region of memory.
-   **Sockets:** A socket is an endpoint for communication.

## Network Structure

The Linux networking stack is responsible for managing the network interfaces of the system.

-   **TCP/IP:** The TCP/IP protocol suite is the standard for communication on the Internet.
-   **Sockets:** The socket interface is used to access the networking stack.

## Security

Linux provides a number of security features, including:
-   **File Permissions:** File permissions are used to control access to files.
-   **User Accounts:** User accounts are used to control access to the system.
-   **SELinux:** SELinux is a security module that provides mandatory access control.
