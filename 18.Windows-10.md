# Chapter 18: Windows 10

## History

Windows is a series of graphical interface operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. Microsoft first introduced an operating environment named Windows in November 1985 as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

Windows 10 is the successor to Windows 8.1 and was released to manufacturing on July 15, 2015, and broadly released for retail sale on July 29, 2015.

## Design Principles

The Windows 10 operating system is designed to be a complete, all-in-one operating system for a wide variety of devices, from desktops and laptops to tablets and smartphones.

The design principles of Windows 10 include:
-   **Portability:** Windows 10 is designed to be portable to a wide variety of hardware platforms.
-   **Security:** Windows 10 includes a number of security features, such as BitLocker drive encryption and Windows Defender.
-   **Compatibility:** Windows 10 is designed to be compatible with a wide variety of software and hardware.
-   **Performance:** Windows 10 is designed to be a high-performance operating system.

## System Components

The Windows 10 architecture is a layered architecture.
-   **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):** The HAL is a layer of software that hides the details of the hardware from the rest of the operating system.
-   **Kernel:** The kernel is the core of the operating system. It is responsible for managing the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
-   **Executive:** The executive is a collection of modules that provide a variety of services, such as process management, memory management, and I/O management.
-   **Subsystems:** Windows 10 supports a number of subsystems, such as the Win32 subsystem, which provides the API for Windows applications.

## Terminal Services and Fast User Switching

-   **Terminal Services:** Terminal Services is a component of Windows that allows a user to access applications and data on a remote computer over a network.
-   **Fast User Switching:** Fast user switching is a feature that allows multiple users to be logged in to a computer at the same time.

## File System

Windows 10 supports a number of file systems, including:
-   **NTFS (New Technology File System):** The default file system in Windows 10. NTFS supports a number of advanced features, such as file and folder permissions, encryption, and compression.
-   **FAT (File Allocation Table):** A legacy file system that is still supported for compatibility with older devices.
-   **ReFS (Resilient File System):** A new file system that is designed to be more resilient to data corruption than NTFS.

## Networking

Windows 10 includes a number of networking features, such as:
-   **TCP/IP:** The TCP/IP protocol suite is the standard for communication on the Internet.
-   **Sockets:** The socket interface is used to access the networking stack.
-   **SMB (Server Message Block):** The SMB protocol is used for file and printer sharing in Windows networks.

## Programmer Interface

The programmer interface to Windows 10 is the Win32 API. The Win32 API is a set of functions that can be used to create Windows applications.

-   **Processes and Threads:** The Win32 API provides a number of functions for creating and managing processes and threads.
-   **Memory Management:** The Win32 API provides a number of functions for managing memory.
-   **I/O:** The Win32 API provides a number of functions for performing I/O.
