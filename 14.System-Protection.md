# Chapter 14: System Protection

## Goals of Protection

Protection is a mechanism for controlling the access of programs, processes, or users to the resources defined by a computer system. This mechanism must provide a means for specification of the controls to be imposed and a means of enforcement.

The primary goals of protection are:
-   **To prevent unauthorized access:** Ensure that resources are accessed only by those who are allowed to do so.
-   **To ensure that each component of a system uses system resources only in ways consistent with stated policies.**
-   **To improve reliability** by detecting latent errors at the interfaces between component subsystems.

## Principles of Protection

A guiding principle for protection is the **principle of least privilege**. This principle dictates that programs, users, and even systems be given just enough privileges to perform their tasks.

This principle helps to limit the damage that can be caused by a faulty program or a security breach. If a program has fewer privileges, it can do less harm.

## Domain of Protection

A computer system is a collection of processes and objects. Objects are the resources that need to be protected, such as files, devices, and memory segments. A **domain** is a set of access rights. An access right is a permission to perform an operation on an object.

A process operates within a protection domain. The domain specifies the resources that the process may access. Each domain defines a set of objects and the types of operations that may be invoked on each object.

## Access Matrix

Our model of protection can be abstractly viewed as a matrix, called an **access matrix**. The rows of the access matrix represent domains, and the columns represent objects. Each entry `access(i, j)` defines the set of operations that a process executing in domain `Di` can invoke on object `Oj`.

The access matrix is a general model of protection, but it is rarely implemented as a simple matrix because it would be too large and sparse.

## Implementation of Access Matrix

There are several ways to implement the access matrix:

-   **Global Table:** The simplest implementation of the access matrix is a global table consisting of a set of ordered triples `<domain, object, rights-set>`.
-   **Access Lists for Objects:** Each column in the access matrix can be implemented as an **access-control list (ACL)** for one object. The ACL for an object is a list of all domains that have access to the object and the operations they are allowed to perform.
-   **Capability Lists for Domains:** Rather than associating the columns of the access matrix with the objects as access lists, we can associate each row with its domain. A **capability list** for a domain is a list of objects together with the operations allowed on those objects.
-   **A Lock-Key Mechanism:** The lock-key scheme is a compromise between access lists and capability lists. Each object has a list of unique bit patterns, called locks. Each domain has a list of unique bit patterns, called keys. A process executing in a domain can access an object only if that domain has a key that matches one of the locks of the object.

## Access Control

Access control is the mechanism by which the system grants or revokes the right to access some data, or to perform some action.

-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** In RBAC, access is based on the role of the user in the organization. Roles are defined based on job functions. Permissions are assigned to roles, and users are assigned to roles.

## Revocation of Access Rights

In a dynamic system, we may sometimes need to revoke access rights to objects shared by different users.

-   **Immediate vs. Delayed:** Revocation can be immediate or delayed.
-   **Selective vs. General:** We may want to revoke access for only a subset of the users who have access to an object.
-   **Partial vs. Total:** We may want to revoke only a subset of the access rights for an object.

## Capability-Based Systems

In a capability-based system, a capability is a token, ticket, or key that gives the possessor the right to access an object. It is a managed, protected pointer that contains both the address of an object and the access rights to that object.

## Language-Based Protection

Language-based protection specifies the protection needs at the time of compilation. The compiler can check for protection violations at compile time. This approach can provide a high degree of security, but it is limited to the protection that can be expressed in the programming language.
