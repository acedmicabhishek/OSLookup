# Chapter 20: Virtualization

## Overview

Virtualization is a technology that allows a single physical computer to be partitioned into multiple virtual machines (VMs). Each VM can run its own operating system and applications, and it is isolated from the other VMs.

Virtualization is a key technology in cloud computing, and it is also used in a wide variety of other applications, such as server consolidation, software testing, and disaster recovery.

## Types of Virtualization

There are two main types of virtualization:
1.  **Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-Metal):** The hypervisor is installed directly on the physical hardware.
2.  **Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted):** The hypervisor is installed on top of an existing operating system.

## Virtualization and Operating-System Components

-   **CPU Virtualization:** The hypervisor is responsible for scheduling the VMs on the physical CPU.
-   **Memory Virtualization:** The hypervisor is responsible for managing the physical memory of the system and for allocating memory to the VMs.
-   **I/O Virtualization:** The hypervisor is responsible for managing the I/O devices of the system and for providing I/O services to the VMs.

## Examples

-   **VMware:** A popular commercial virtualization product.
-   **KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine):** An open-source virtualization solution that is built into the Linux kernel.
-   **Xen:** An open-source hypervisor that is used in a number of cloud computing platforms, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
-   **VirtualBox:** An open-source hypervisor that is popular for desktop virtualization.
